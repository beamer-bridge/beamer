# Beamer Bridge
*Transfer ERC20 assets directly between EVM compatible rollups - with a world class user experience*

Beamer is a protocol to enable users to move tokens from one rollup to another.
The user requests a transfer by providing tokens on the source rollup.
Liquidity providers then fill the request and directly send tokens to the user
on the target rollup.
