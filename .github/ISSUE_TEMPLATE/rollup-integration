### Required documentation

Beamer Bridge has some requirements to integrate new rollups. It makes use of messaging layers to prove a rollup's state on L1.

#### Local testing
Please provide information on how to run a local L1/L2 deployment of the rollup.

Links to documentation:

#### Messaging
Please provide information on how to send AND retrieve arbitrary messages natively from L1 -> L2 and L2 -> L1.

Links to documentation:

#### Origin sender
Please provide information on how to prove the origin sender on the destination chain (i.e. prove the L2 origin sender on L1 for an L2 -> L1 message).

Links to documentation:

#### Source for fee calculation
Please provide information on where we can get information needed for fee calculation.

#### Contract verification
Please provide information on how to verify contracts, e.g. whether it will just work
via existing contract verification mechanisms, or if additional work is needed
(for instance, writing a new ape plugin). If additional work is needed, write relevant
issues.
